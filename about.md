<!-- ![Ahmed Nadar](../images/avatar.png "Ahmed Nadar") -->

Welcome to Thinking Out Load. 

My name is Ahmed Nadar. I'm a web developer with a web design background and live in Toronto. Thinking Out Load (TOL) is where I share my thoughts through Coffee Time, write code and showcase my work. 

Please check [my portfolio on Heroku](http://ahmednadar.herokuapp.com/) where I show the latest projects I [worked](http://ahmednadar.herokuapp.com/work) on.

Thanks for visiting.
