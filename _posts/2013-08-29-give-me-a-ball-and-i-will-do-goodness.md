**Good Day!**

<p>Want to make people run? Don’t give them a badge for running. Give them a ball and shove four sticks in the ground. They’ll run around the field chasing the ball (and each other) for ages. The experience is intrinsically challenging and amusing, and the running is a by-product. Games rely on dynamics like these and rules to generate the conditions for positive engagement.</p>

<p>These dynamics are all based on basic principles. Chief among these principles are Motivation, Feedback, and Challenge.</p>

<p>Life is ambiguous. Games are not. At every moment in a game, your goal, your motivation as a player is clear. When it changes, this is clearly marked. Your clarity of action is perfect, existential angst disappears. This is a rewardign state of being. Many other activities in life are frustrating because these conditions don’t apply, so there’s no way to know how you’re doing.</p>
