**Good Day!**

<p>When i decide to learn Ruby and Ruby on Rails, I have done good search for what is the best way to learn RoR. The community online is marvellous. Since RoR is kind of new kid in the programming framework area, I have found many resources and different way to learn. </p>

<p>I like learning from videos, it does help clearing up some area it’s hard to be describe if its written lesson.. Beside watching live code is exciting. But in the same time, it has its cons, which its one way teaching. No communication with the author or other learners like me.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Writing lessons has its advantages as well. When the author writes in details and mentions how and why behind each line of code, it rocks.</p>

<p>I can see Its not easy to teach and write online is not as easy as doing in class, or with attendees. </p>

<p>Lately I discovered new way of learning, not exactly, but the method <a href="http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/">Zed A. Shaw</a> follow is kind of new to me. It’s not a rocket science but it’s different from the rest.</p>

<p>Zed A. Shaw followed an easy method but hard in the same time. It’s easy to write simple lesson contain very little to learn but in the same time its very important and you can not move to next lesson before grasping all details in current lesson. </p>

<p>In the same time, he created an environment for everyone to ask and participate in  every lesson. What is cool about that is, he answers all question which is wonderful. Also I can see what others are talking about or similar issues to mine and how it is been solved. Awesome.</p>

<p>The hard way in my opinion is, he give tasks needs to be done in order to understand more and practice beside he encourage to read and search online for specific method or class that would help understand his code.</p>

<p>I have found my self write more code since each lesson contain small chunk of code, search online for any mysterious methods and classes. With more reading, practice and hand on code all the time, I discovered I learn a lot and pay attention to details.</p>

<p>I’d agree with <a href="http://www.mkltesthead.com/2011/10/practicum-learning-ruby-hard-way-why.html">Michael Larsen</a> “I can’t just build a tool and blindly and half-understandingly maintain it. I need to develop the knowledge necessary to build stuff from scratch and then be abe to maintain, grow or restart different projects. The simple hack approach won’t cut it going forward, so I have to go for it and make this all work. A bit every day (and a missive writing about it)”</p>

<p>Its <a href="http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/">hard way of learning</a> but its more enjoyable which it easier to learn.</p>
