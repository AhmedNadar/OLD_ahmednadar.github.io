### This is the data for my blog [ahmednadar.github.io](http://ahmednadar.github.io/)

It is automatically transformed by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub.

* I was tired of having my blog posts end up in a database off on some remote server. That is backwards. Iâ€™ve lost valuable posts that way. I want to author my posts locally in Markdown (*awesome*). 
* My blog should be easily stylable and customizable any way I please. It should take care of creating a feed for me. And most of all, my site should be stored on GitHub so that I never lose data again.
* I'm having fun using Jekyll and hope you enjoy my blog.
